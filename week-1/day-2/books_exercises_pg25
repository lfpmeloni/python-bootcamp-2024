# TRY IT YOURSELF
# Save each of the following exercises as a separate file, with a name like name
# _cases.py. If you get stuck, take a break or see the suggestions in Appendix C.
# 2-3. Personal Message: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and print
# a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric,
# would you like to learn some Python today?”

name = "Jon Doe"
message = f"Hello {name}, enjoying Python?"
print(message)

# 2-4. Name Cases: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and then print
# that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.

print(name.lower())
print(name.upper())
print(name.title())

# 2-5. Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the
# quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the
# following, including the quotation marks:
# Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never
# tried anything new.”

author = "Carl Sagan"
quote = "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."
message = f"People say {author} is a skeptic because he once said: '{quote}'"
print(message)

# 2-6. Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time, represent the famous
# person’s name using a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and represent it with a new variable called message. Print your message.

""" Respeita minha história """

# 2-7. Stripping Names: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and
# include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
# Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
# Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(),
# rstrip(), and strip().

fuzy_name = " Luis\t \nFelipe "
print(fuzy_name, fuzy_name.strip())

# 2-8. File Extensions: Python has a removesuffix() method that works exactly
# like removeprefix(). Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called
# filename. Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without
# the file extension, like some file browsers do.

filename = "python_notes.txt"
print(filename.removesuffix(".txt"))
