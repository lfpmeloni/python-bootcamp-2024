# Exercise 9)
# Create an empty list that contains two empty lists as elements.
# Then write a loop (large loop) that varies the loop from task 1 (small loop) by making the end value of the small loop dependent on the iteration parameter of the large loop. So, in the first run, the small loop should run from 1 to 30, in the next run from 1 to 31, and so on.
# Measure the runtime of the small loop and store this in one of the sublists. In the second sublist, store the number of iterations (30, 31, ...).
# Create a graph where you visualize the runtime and the number of repeats of the loop.
# Tip: For the creating the graph you can use the matlibplot.pyplot package.
# Tip2: Choose larger parameters, to measure the runtime. E.g. 10000+
