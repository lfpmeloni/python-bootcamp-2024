# Exercises week 3
# This week, the focus is on creating a text-based project using classes and other principles learned so
# far. "Text-Based" implies that the user interacts with the program through console inputs, and actions
# are performed based on user input. The process should follow these steps:
# 1. Decide on the overall concept of the program. Keep it simple for now.
# 2. Determine what classes can be used for different purposes in the program.
# 3. Implement the program's logic, including functions and adjustments to the classes based on
# user input.
# 4. Keep classes and functions in a separate script from the main script. Use docstrings for
# documentation.
# Here are various ideas that can serve as a foundation or inspiration. Feel free to develop your own
# concept, be creative, and have fun!
# Idea 1: Text-based Adventure Game!
# Classic Dungeon Crawler: Users create a character who explores a dungeon, finding treasures and
# battling monsters.
# The Explorer: Users enter a cave/forest/house and can explore the surroundings.
# Idea 2: Text-based Mystery Game!
# Like the Explorer concept: Users enter a location and must solve a mystery by finding clues and solving
# puzzles.
# Idea 3: Text-based Decision-Making!
# Ethical Dilemmas: Users are presented with an ethical dilemma and must decide.
